## Running

To run locally, you'll need to set environment variables holding secrets. The secrets file, with credentials to a live postgresql db, is exceptionally included in the repo. In bash, for example:

	source env.sh

Then

	node main.js

Then in your browser, go to <http://localhost:3000/index.html>
